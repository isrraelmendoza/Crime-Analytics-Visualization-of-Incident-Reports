Using the SF summer 2014 dataset, I decided to focus on the top 10 reported crimes in the data. I subsetted the data so that it only contained the following data set:

|	Category   |  IncidntNum |
|---|---|
|	ASSAULT        |   2882  |
|DRUG/NARCOTIC   |   1345  |
|LARCENY/THEFT   |   9466  |
| MISSING PERSON |   1266  |
| NON-CRIMINAL   |   3023  |
| OTHER OFFENSES |   3567  |
|SECONDARY CODES |   442   |
| SUSPICIOUS OCC |   1300  |
| VEHICLE THEFT  |   1966  |
| WARRANTS       |   1782  |

Then we explored what resolution was being taken against the crime incidents:
